# DocBook customizations for my MA thesis in computer science 

This repo holds a project file for DocBook customizations in the oXygen XML editor.
After cloning this repo, just open the `db-thesis.xpr` file and your editor should recognize
the schema extensions necessary to validate the main thesis file `src/Masterarbeit_Haupttext.xml`.

To render a PDF output file, run the transformation scenario `DocBook PDF for Thesis`.

If you want to examine the customizations, check the xsl and rnc files in the `docbook` folder.
